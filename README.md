## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A local web server (optional, but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[repository-name].git
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Open the website**
   
   **Option A: Using a local server (Recommended)**
   - If you have Python installed:
     ```bash
     # Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Python 2
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
     ```
   - Then open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
   
   - If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx serve`:
     ```bash
     npx serve
     ```
   
   **Option B: Direct file opening**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Note: Some features may work better with a local server

3. **Navigate the website**
   - Use the navigation bar to switch between Home, About Us, and Contact Us pages
